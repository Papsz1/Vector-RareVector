# Vector-RareVector
The project contains the implementation of vector and rare vector template classes. 
An object of type vvector contains two elements: a dynamic array and the number of elements.
A rare vector is a vector which only contains the non zero elements of a vector.
An object of type rarevvector contains 3 elements: a dynamic array, the number of all elements, and the number of non zero elements.
For these, I implemented the following methods: 
 - Constructor
 - Destructor
 - Addition
 - Subtraction
 - Scalar product
 - Euclidean norm
 - Euclidean distance
 - [] index operator overload
I also implemented type conversion between the two classes.
